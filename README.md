# React Awesome Form Validation

This library is a simple solution of a common issue with forms with custom validations using ReactJs. It lets you use a pre-defined Input or even create your custom one with all it needs to be part of the same form.

### Examples
Simple Form: 
    - run: `make run-simple-form`

Form with custom Input: 
    - run: `run-form-with-custom-input`

Then open a browser and type: `http://localhost:3000`

Hope you enjoy it!
